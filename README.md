About Attack Sequences.txtï¼š

The file "Attack Sequences.txt" contains a portion of the attack sequences we generated using Chatgpt and Deepseek based on 63 publicly available CTI reports collected from https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/. 

Due to the vast number of specific entity names that can be generated within each attack entry, for ease of reading, we only display one set of examples of the sequences generated for each report (one for Linux and one for Windows systems). 

Readers can use these sequences to continue generating more sequences containing different entities using large language models. 

Additionally, because the available information in a small number of reports is somewhat limited or vague, we only present the valid sequences that can be used for training after generation.
